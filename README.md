    			<h1>About</h1>
                <p>I started working on <strong>The Odin Project<strong> about two weeks ago. So far im enjoying everything about it. The way this course was put together is extremely helpful for someone like me with zero experience in this field. I'm very excited to pursue my interest in coding. With me being a hands on learner <strong>The Odin Project<strong> has given me the opportunity to jump in hands on with no cost. Im not even halfway through and im hooked. In no way is this 
                easy but im looking forward to this journey.</p><p>During this project I'm going to be applying everything I've learned so far to create a basic website. I will be put to the test linking images to files, creating links to other pages, and furthering my <strong>COMMANDS<strong> knowledge. I will be adding lists along with images for each page on this website. From <em>COMMANDS<em> in the terminal, to editing in <em>VCS<em>, to <em>COMMITTING<em> and saving projects in <github>. I will be furthering my experience as a coder in no time.</p><p>This project will have a home page with food recipes. you will be able to click on the <en>Dish<en> of your choice and the website will take you to the recipe page. While on the recipe page you will be able to see an image of the dish with a brief description. Below that will be a list of ingredients followed by a step by step list to cook this recipe. Time to put everything I've learned to the test.</p>
