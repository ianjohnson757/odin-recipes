About


	I started working on The Odin Project about two weeks ago. So far im enjoying everything about it. The way this course was put together is extremely helpful for someone like me with zero experience in this field. I'm very excited to pursue my interest in coding. With me being a hands on learner The Odin Project has given me the opportunity to jump in hands on with no cost. I'm not even halfway through and I'm hooked. In no way is this easy but I'm looking forward to this journey.


	
	During this project I'm going to be applying everything I've learned so far to create a basic website. I will be put to the test linking images to files, creating links to other pages, and furthering my COMMANDS knowledge. I will be adding lists along with images for each page on this website. From COMMANDS in the terminal, to editing in VCS, to COMMITTING and saving projects in github. I will be furthering my experience as a coder in no time.


	
	This project will have a home page with food recipes. you will be able to click on the Dish of your choice and the website will take you to the recipe page. While on the recipe page you will be able to see an image of the dish with a brief description. Below that will be a list of ingredients followed by a step by step list to cook this recipe. Time to put everything I've learned to the test.

	

	I just finished the HTML portion of this project. I encountered lots of issues with linking files, certain codes, and structures. This was a wonderful learning experience. I feel so much more comfortable already and I'm looking forward to the next chapter.
