                </ul>
           <p>Time to get cooking:</p>        
               <ol>
                       <li>Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F. </li>
                       <li>Generously salt and pepper the chuck roast. </li>
                       <li>Heat the olive oil in large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the halved onions to th
                        e pot, browning them on both sides. Remove the onions to a plate. </li>
                       <li>Throw the carrots into the same very hot pot and toss them around a bit until slightly browned,
                         about a minute or so. Reserve the carrots with the onions</li>
                         <li>If needed, add a bit more olive oil to the very hot pot. Place the meat in the pot and sear it for about a minute
                             on all sides until it is nice and brown all over. Remove the roast to a plate. </li>
                         <li>With the burner still on high, use either red wine or beef broth (about 1 cup) to deglaze the pot, scraping the bottom with a whisk. Place 
                            the roast back into the pot and add enough beef stock to cover the meat halfway. </li>
                         <li>Add in the onions and the carrots, along with the fresh herbs. </li>
                         <li>Put the lid on, then roast for 3 hours for a 3-pound roast. For a 4 to 5-pound roast, plan on 4 hours. 
                            The roast is ready when it's fall-apart tender.</li>
